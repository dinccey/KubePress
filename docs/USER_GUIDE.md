# User Guide

Welcome to the User Guide! This document provides comprehensive instructions to help you effectively use KubePress.

As explained in the Quick Start, deploying a WordPress instance with KubePress involves two steps:
1. Create a Secret containing the WordPress credentials (These will be used as the intial username/password for WordPress, SFTP and the Database user).
2. Create a WordPress Custom Resource that references the Secret created in step 1.

### Create a Secret for WordPress Credentials

To create a WordPress instance, you need to create a secret first.

A fully functional Secret for a WordPress Instance looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1  
data:
  database: d3AtLWhvc3R6ZXJvLS13MS1jb20=
  databaseHost: a3ViZXByZXNzLmt1YmVwcmVzcy5zdmMuY2x1c3Rlci5sb2NhbA==
  databaseUsername: aG9zdHplcm8tYWRtaW4tYWIyOXNr
  databasePassword: cGFzc3dvcmQK
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQK
  username: YWRtaW4=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: wp--hostzero--w1-com
  namespace: kubepress
type: Opaque
```

The secret must contain the following keys. These are required in any case:
- `username`
- `password`

Optionally, you can also provide:
- `databaseUsername`
    - If this field is provided in the secret, it will be used to create the database user. If not provided, the value from `username` will be used with a random suffix appended to it. The random suffix is to ensure uniqueness of the database user, because all database users will be created in the same database cluster.
- `databasePassword`
    - If this field is provided in the secret, it will be used to create the database user. If not provided, a random password will be generated for the database user. This is optionally independent of the `databaseUsername` field.

If you set the `wp.Spec.Database.CreateNew` to `false`, you must provide the following additional keys in the secret (in addition to `username` and `password`):
- `database`
    - The name of the existing database to use.
- `databaseHost`
    - The host of the existing database to use (and connect to).
- `databaseUsername`
    - The username of the existing database user to use.
- `databasePassword`
    - The password of the existing database user to use.

If you set the `wp.Spec.Database.CreateNew` to `true` (which is the default), you do not need to provide the three additional keys from above. The operator will create a new database and database user for you.

This data will be used to create:
- the SFTP user
- the Database user
- the initial WordPress admin user
- (and also indirectly the access to PHPMyAdmin, because you will need the Database user to access PHPMyAdmin)

After the initial creation of the WordPress instance, an update of username/password in the secret will not update:
- the Admin user in WordPress
- the password in the Database
    - However, you can set a label to the secret, and the MariaDB operator will pick up the change and update the password in the database. According to the [MariaDB Operator documentation](https://github.com/mariadb-operator/mariadb-operator/blob/main/docs/api_reference.md#userspec), you can set the label `k8s.mariadb.com/watch` on the secret, and the operator will watch for changes.

The newly updated credentials will be used in the deployment after a restart of the pods.

### Create a WordPress Custom Resource

After creating the secret, you can create a WordPress Custom Resource that references the secret.

A fully functional WordPress Custom Resource looks like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: crm.hostzero.de/v1
kind: WordPressSite
metadata:
  name: wp--w2-com
  namespace: kubepress
spec:
  adminEmail: admin@example.com
  adminUserSecretKeyRef: wp--w2-com
  database:
    createNew: true
  ingress:
    host: w2.com
    tls: false
  siteTitle: w2
  wordpress:
    image: wordpress:latest
    maxUploadLimit: 64M
    replicas: 1
    resources:
      cpuLimit: 500m
      cpuRequest: 250m
      memoryLimit: 1Gi
      memoryRequest: 512Mi
    storageSize: 10Gi
```

### Disabling Automatic Ingress Creation

By default, KubePress automatically creates an Ingress resource for your WordPress site. However, you can disable this behavior if you want to manage the Ingress manually or use a different ingress configuration.

To disable automatic ingress creation, set the `ingress.disabled` field to `true`:

```yaml
apiVersion: crm.hostzero.de/v1
kind: WordPressSite
metadata:
  name: wordpress-no-ingress
spec:
  # ... other fields ...
  ingress:
    host: example.com
    tls: false
    disabled: true  # This prevents automatic ingress creation
```

When `ingress.disabled` is set to `true`:
- No Ingress resource will be created by the operator
- If an Ingress was previously created by the operator, it will be deleted
- You can manually create your own Ingress resource or use an alternative ingress solution

**Note:** Even when ingress is disabled, you still need to provide the `ingress.host` field as it may be used for other purposes within the operator.

For more information about the fields in the WordPress Custom Resource, please look directly at the [wordpresssite_types.go](../api/v1/wordpresssite_types.go) file in the `api/v1` directory.
